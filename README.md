## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Not much, considering I was able to get the design done using what I already knew. If nything, this was good practice for my planning skills on whether and how I should have used flexbox or grid for styling, but I think I did pretty well on that department.

### Continued development

I'm not really sure I understood what I had to add to the markdown to make my page more accessible, so I'd like to keep studying the whole WAI ARIA thing.
